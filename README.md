This is my personal Linux-notes taken from teaching Linux basics to students. If you find anything that should be corrected or added, please commit!

Remember that this will never be a complete guide to Linux. First of all I only teach what I know (and I have a LOT of limitations!), secondly my Linux-courses are always limited in length so short-cuts and simplifications the way I work. :)
